- ðŸ”­ When I learn enough about apps I would love to make the simplest and the best open source revsion app (My inspiration came from Space:Spaced Repition)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning A levels on Physics, CS and Maths
- ðŸ˜Ž I don't know how , but i would love to collaborate with someone to make Maxim work for all subjects.
- ðŸ’» Fun fact: I use ChatGPT for revision for school

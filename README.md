<h2> Hello there 👋</h2>

🌱 My name is Alvin and I love making mini practical projects as they help me develop my coding skills and they are fun to do. I also integratee  AI to speed up my workflow like ChatGPT search to help find docuentation faster so I focus on problem solving rather that rote syntax memorisation (I like to work smarter not harder 🧠).
